# Zenith Documentation Improvement Plan

## Objective
Achieve Rails/Django/FastAPI-level documentation **quality** (not quantity) by creating comprehensive, practical, and production-ready guides that developers need to succeed with Zenith.

## Quality Standards (Match Rails/Django)
- **Clear Learning Path**: Progressive from beginner to advanced
- **Real Examples**: Production patterns, not toy demos
- **Problem-First**: Show the problem, then the solution
- **Complete Code**: Runnable examples with context
- **Testing Included**: Show how to test everything
- **Production Ready**: Include deployment and scaling
- **Troubleshooting**: Common errors and solutions

## Documentation Standards

### Every Guide Must Have:
```markdown
1. **Overview** - What problem does this solve?
2. **Prerequisites** - What knowledge is needed?
3. **Core Concepts** - Key ideas explained
4. **Step-by-Step Examples** - Progressive complexity
5. **Testing** - How to test this feature
6. **Common Patterns** - Best practices
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common errors and fixes
8. **Performance** - Optimization tips
9. **Security** - Security considerations
10. **Next Steps** - Where to learn more
```

### Code Example Standards:
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Explains context and decisions
async def create_user(user_data: UserCreate, db=DB) -> User:
    """
    Create a new user with validation.

    Steps:
    1. Check email uniqueness
    2. Hash password securely
    3. Create user record
    4. Send welcome email

    Raises:
        ValueError: If email already exists

    Returns:
        Created user instance
    """
    # Check if email already registered
    if await User.find_by_email(user_data.email):
        raise ValueError("Email already registered")

    # Hash password using bcrypt (never store plaintext)
    hashed_password = hash_password(user_data.password)

    # Create user in database
    user = await User.create(
        email=user_data.email,
        password_hash=hashed_password,
        # Set activation token for email verification
        activation_token=generate_token()
    )

    # Queue welcome email (async to not block response)
    await queue_email(user.email, "welcome")

    return user

# ❌ BAD: No context or explanation
async def create_user(data):
    user = User(**data)
    db.add(user)
    await db.commit()
    return user
```

## Notes

- **Focus on Quality**: Better to have 20 excellent guides than 100 mediocre ones
- **Real-World Focus**: Every example should be production-viable
- **Progressive Learning**: Build concepts gradually
- **Test Everything**: All code must be tested and runnable
- **Community Driven**: Gather feedback and iterate

*This plan will transform Zenith documentation from basic to professional-grade, matching the quality standards of Rails, Django, and FastAPI.*
